% {{{ END OF CODE --- Guess I should provide an explanation:
% 
% We can draw from axis aligned unit Gaussians with randn(d)
% 	x ~ A*exp(-0.5*x'*x)
% We can then rotate this distribution using
% 	y = U'*x
% Note that
% 	x = inv(U')*y
% Our new variable y is distributed according to:
% 	y ~ B*exp(-0.5*y'*inv(U'*U)*y)
% or
% 	y ~ N(0,Sigma)
% where
% 	Sigma = U'*U
% For a given Sigma we can use the chol function to find the corresponding U,
% draw x and find y. We can adjust for a non-zero mean by just adding it on.
% 
% But the Cholsky decomposition function doesn't always work...
% Consider Sigma=[1 1;1 1]. Now inv(Sigma) doesn't actually exist, but Matlab's
% mvnrnd provides samples with this covariance st x(1)~N(0,1) x(2)=x(1). The
% fast way to deal with this would do something similar to chol but be clever
% when the rows aren't linearly independent. However, I can't be bothered, so
% another way of doing the decomposition is by diagonalising Sigma (which is
% slower but works).
% if
% 	[E,Lambda]=eig(Sigma)
% then
% 	Sigma = E*Lambda*E'
% so
% 	U = sqrt(Lambda)*E'
% If any Lambdas are negative then Sigma just isn't even positive semi-definite
% so we can give up.
