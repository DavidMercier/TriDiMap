Indentation grid technique
---------------------------

Mechanical property mapping are generated by plotting (nano-)indentation results obtained using the grid indentation technique.
The nanoindentation grid technique is well described in the paper written by Constantinides et al. [#Constantinides_2006]_,
but also in the following references [#Němeček_2009]_ and [#Randall_2009]_.

Position of each (nano-)indentation test or distance between indents has to be known or recorded,
in order to plot a consistent mechanical property map representative of the experiment.
An example of 2D generated hardness map is given below. By default, a pixelized map is plotted.
Each pixel represents an indentation test and the color of a pixel corresponds to the the intensity of the calculated mechanical property.
In the given following screenshot, the white pixels corresponds to tests, which failed (NaN = Not a numeric).
Indentation failure corresponds to traditional artifacts of indentation testing (error on surface detection beceause of contamination/roughness/topography effects, error with the thermal drift correction, etc...) 
A ratio of failed tests over total number of indentation tests is given on the left part of the GUI.
To remove these empty pixels, it is possible to tick a checkbox into the settings on the GUI,
and a mechanical property value is attributed to the empty pixel, by doing a simple averaging of the surrounding pixels (8 in total).

Indentation length scales
---------------------------

According to Constantinides et al. [#Constantinides_2006]_, the indentation depth :math:`h` should be at most 1/10 of the characteristic size of the microstructure :math:`D` (e.g.: particle size in a matrix, grain or void diameter...), in order to apply continuum indentation analysis to heterogeneous systems and  to  access  phase  properties.  This rule refers to the well-known 10% rule of thumb proposed by Buckle [#Buckle_1973]_, which is a rough first estimatio. In cases where the contrast between the mechanical properties of the two phases becomes significant (e.g.: ratio between the elastic modulii lower than 0.2 or higher than 5), the method is not really reliable anymore and special care should be taken in the interpretation of the indentation results.

Vizualization of maps
-----------------------

It is possible to plot similar other maps using different functions of Matlab, like 2D, 3D
--> Type of 2D maps
--> Colorbar / Normalization / Translation
--> Log / Grid / Indents positions

..  warning::
    Indentation experiments are very sensitive to environmental effects and thermal drift.
	Usually, performing such indentation maps can be time-consuming....
