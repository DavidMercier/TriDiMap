(Nano-)Indentation mapping
==========================

.. include:: includes.rst

Mechanical property mapping are generated by plotting (nano-)indentation results obtained using the grid indentation technique. The nanoindentation grid technique is well described in the paper written by ....

Position of each (nano-)indentation test or distance between indents has to be known or recorded, in order to plot a consistent mechanical property map representative of the experiment. An example of 2D generated hardness map is given below. By default, a pixelized map is plotted. Each pixel represents an indentation test and the color of a pixel corresponds to the the intensity of the calculated mechanical property.

   It is possible to plot similar other maps using different functions of Matlab, like 2D, 3D
